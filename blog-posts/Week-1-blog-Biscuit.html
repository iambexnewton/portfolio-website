    <h1>What’s your favourite biscuit?</h1>

    <h2>
      A round up of my first week in a
      <a href="https://northcoders.com/ ">Northcoders</a> bootcamp.
    </h2>
    <p>
      What’s your favourite biscuit? That’s how it begins. All the anxiety, the
      dreams about those pesky missing curly brackets just melt away. The
      obvious Jaffa cake conundrum aside, within 10 minutes we have all settled
      into our new life as
      <a href="https://northcoders.com/ ">Northcoders</a> cohorts. (If you want
      to know, my biscuit of choice was a caramel milk chocolate digestive.)
    </p>

    <p>
      This first week is designed as an introduction to the course, to help
      familiarise ourselves with the concepts we will be using everyday. Like
      <a href="https://github.com/"> github</a>, and the Command Line. Things I
      had not even considered before applying for a place on the course. If you
      are reading this because you are considering joining a
      <a href="https://northcoders.com/ ">Northcoders</a> bootcamp and are
      thinking “But I just want to write code and build things!” Trust me, you
      will have a hard time doing that without these tools.
      <a href="https://github.com/"> github</a> is a fantastic cloud based Git
      repository used for version control and collaboration on projects. The
      first time I was faced with the command line I was mildly panicked, but
      honestly it is not as intimidating as it looks. It takes in commands which
      it passes on to the operating system to run. It can be used as a more
      efficient way of manoeuvring in and out of files.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are introduced to these tools all at once, which could feel
      overwhelming, but the bootcamp has been designed so that you are made to
      perform the same commands repeatedly and by the end of the week you are
      using these commands without having to think.
    </p>

    <h3>What happens on a typical day</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>8:30am</strong> A warm up in the morning of either reading
      materials, katas or a list of a few topics the tutors want us to research
      before our lectures.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>9–10am</strong> A morning lecture. This weeks topics covered:
      <a href="https://github.com/"> github</a>, the command line, Visual studio
      code and conditional logic.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the lecture you get a series of exercises and questions to attempt.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2–3pm</strong> We have another lecture, this weeks topics covered:
      ReGex, Higher Order Functions, exports and require.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the afternoon lecture has finished we receive more materials to work
      through!
    </p>

    <p>
      The volume of exercises and questions you get is quite high for a
      CodeNewbie like me, but they do stress they do not expect us to finish all
      of the questions .(Which is a good job because if I could, I probably
      wouldn’t need to be on a bootcamp!)
    </p>

    <p><strong>5pm</strong> Home time!</p>

    <h3>Thoughts on this week</h3>
    <p>
      I was concerned about learning such an intense concept remotely. There are
      a few different things Northcoders have implemented to try and bring the
      school room to the virtual room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nchelp is a helpdesk which is accessed by the command line (of course,
      they wouldn’t miss an opportunity for us to practice that skill) Supported
      by a plethora of fantastic tutors that will hop on a personal zoom call to
      help clarify concepts. You never feel like they are rushing you, all the
      while reassuring you of your abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is also the slack channel for you to chat with your cohorts and to
      bounce ideas around. Like, why, do we still keep typing in our slack
      channels “git status”.
    </p>

    <p>
      There have been highs, and there have been lows this week. It’s hard work,
      it truly is, but you get back what you put in. YOU are in the driving
      seat, they’re just holding the map.
