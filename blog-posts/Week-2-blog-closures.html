    <h2>
      A round up of my second week in a
      <a href="https://northcoders.com/ ">Northcoders</a> bootcamp.
    </h2>

    <p>
      The week is a part of our Javascript Fundamentals block. It has the same
      structure of the previous week, we would have katas and questions in the
      morning to work though then a lecture. Most likely structured in this way
      to enable us to get creative, and get thinking (read that as, get googling
      and scouring <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3</a> and
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"> MDN</a>
      for hints how to attack the challenge we are faced with.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The course will at first introduce us to a concepts peripherals, and then
      re-visit the concept with a little more detail. I’m becoming a fan of
      this, although the content is full-on I have faith that the course is
      guiding us in a way to build up our knowledge without suffering burn out.
    </p>

    <h2>What we covered this week…</h2>

    <p><strong> MONDAY: Test driven design & Jest </strong></p>
    <p>
      We were introduced to Test driven design or TDD, and testing with Jest. I
      can say I am a huge fan of both. If you are just learning as I am, I would
      definitely say to look into installing Jest!
    </p>

    <p><strong> TUESDAY: Dry & Pure functions. Scope & Hoisting.</strong></p>

    <p>
      DRY and Pure. Pure functions will not mutate the input and the input will
      always return the same output (which fits in perfectly with learning TDD)
      The concept of DRY is the idea that when writing code you don’t repeat
      yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scope and Hoisting. You can write a function but you don’t know why when
      you return a variable its coming back undefined then this is the lesson
      you need. It felt like a lot was happening today, two separate concepts
      delivered that dive into the WHY of Javascript. This lecture was
      fantastic, using diagrams and thorough explanations to help solidify our
      knowledge on what is happening in our code, we were introduced to the call
      stack, global variable, thread (local thread) and variable expressions .
      This lecture was then built upon throughout the remaining week.
    </p>

    <p><strong> WEDNESDAY: Values vs Reference.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Building on our knowledge gained in the previous two days we were
      introduced to values vs reference. In javascript data is separated into
      values, Primitive and Compound with the 7 main data types falling into the
      Primitive type. The variable that stores a primitive value is accessed by
      the value.
    </p>
    <p>
      A variable that stores an object is accessed by reference, its own place
      in memory.
    </p>

    <p><strong>THURSDAY: Closures.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Sigh. This is what this weeks lectures have been leading to. Closures,
      easier to explain than to put into practice with TDD. I am so very pleased
      that this has been introduced to us so early in the course so we can
      consciously use them through the remainder of the bootcamp. I would advise
      anyone learning about closures to just write the code. Just keep writing
      code.
    </p>

    <p><strong>FRIDAY: Closures.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Closures give you access to an outer functions scope from an inner
      function.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use a closure, you would need a function inside another function and
      return it or pass it to another function.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am so very pleased that this has been introduced to us so early in the
      course so we can consciously use them through the remainder of the
      bootcamp.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Thoughts on this week</strong></p>

    <p>
      This week has been extremely full on. Every day felt like there was not
      enough time to accomplish what I wanted to do in a day. The concepts
      introduced this week have really stretched my brain, but by Friday I could
      write a TDD. Install jest and I could write a function that had a closure.
      Next week I can only get better.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you go into this bootcamp you HAVE to be prepared to keep picking
      yourself up when you hit a wall. The concepts are hard, but everything is
      hard at the beginning. Keep going.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key takeaway from this week is that rest is your best friend. There is
      no shame in taking an extra 10 mins away from the screen to absorb
      information, especially when the weeks start to get intense.
